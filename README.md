# Share to HN (PWA)

A super simple PWA (progressive web application) that adds a sharing option for Hacker News to the sharing menu in your Android device.

In other words, it's a handy mobile alternative for the official HN bookmarklet. That bookmarklet doesn't work in all mobile browsers, at least not in Chrome for Android.

⚠️ The PWA utilizes the experimental `share_target` attribute in the manifest, which as of September 2022 is only supported by Chrome and Edge. Check the up-to-date browser support at caniuse.com.
