# Share to HN (PWA)

A super simple PWA ([progressive web application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)) that adds a sharing option for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to the sharing menu in your Android device.

In other words, it's a handy mobile alternative for the [official HN bookmarklet](https://news.ycombinator.com/bookmarklet.html). That bookmarklet doesn't work in all mobile browsers, at least not in Chrome for Android.

⚠️ The PWA utilizes the experimental `share_target` attribute in the [manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest), which as of September 2022 is only supported by Chrome and Edge.
